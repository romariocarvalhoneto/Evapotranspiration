# Evapotranspiration
Docs and Spreadsheets for Evapotranspiration Estimation

Here we have some docs on the subject and some spreadsheets that are built to 
take daily climatologic data and estimate the reference evapotranpiration for that particular site 
accorsing to its position, following the model described by the Food and Agriculture Organization
of the United States - FAO (at http://www.fao.org/docrep/x0490e/x0490e06.htm) also referred as an 
alternative ETo calculation procedure for situations where some weather variables are missing.
According to this author, even where the data set contains only maximum and minimum air temperature
it is still possible to obtain reasonable estimates of ten-day or monthly ETo with the FAO 
Penman-Monteith equation.
